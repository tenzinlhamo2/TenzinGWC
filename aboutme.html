        <h3>LIKES</h3>

        <div>There are a plethora of things I like. One of my favorite things to do is to travel to new places. I really enjoy exploring different countries and learning more about the culture there. Other things that I like to do is to hang out with my friends and watch movies. It's safe to say that I can do these three things continuesely and not get tired of it any time soon.</div>

            <h3>DISLIKES</h3>

            <div>For one thing, I strongly dislike snakes. Their slithery prescene makes me uncomfortable. Another thing I dislike are staying at home for the entire day. Rather than being a homebody, I love being outdoors.</div>
            <style>
                div {
                    background-color: white;
                    width: 250px;
                    border: 25px solid black;
                    padding: 25px;
                    margin: 25px;
                }

                <h3>FUN FACT</h3>

                <div>A fun fact about me is that as I was growing up, my career goals always changed depending on what I was interested in at the time. When I was younger, I got into cooking and strongly beleived that I would pursue my career as a chef. But, that goal slowly died down as I got extremely interested into fashion. I loved to dress up and look at countless pictures of people's outfits. I am still into fashion but I realized that I would rather keep that as an interest. Right now, I am really determined to learn more about computer science.</div>
